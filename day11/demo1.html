        Liverpool beat West Ham United 2-0 on that day at the latter's home grounds, Upton Park, but for Herman, the experience was about so much more than his team's victory. The stadium in east London has since been demolished, but the feeling of wonder Herman felt standing on the terrace behind the goal there is something he still senses whenever he has the chance to visit a new venue.
With that first match and many others in mind, Herman begins his new book, "Remarkable Football Grounds," with a statement that may surprise many fans currently watching the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Sometimes the game itself, he says, isn't the most interesting part of the story.
